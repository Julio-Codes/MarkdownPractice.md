# Summary
Hello World! I am Mr. Clifford. I am a Computer Science Teacher at Brockton High School. I am also the Web Content Manager for Brockton Public Schools.

Outside of work, I love to learn expand my knowledge of programming. I took the Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree course and earned my certificate. I also love to workout. I try to make it to the gym 5 times a week. The gym is a healthy way for me to relieve stress. My favorite sport is soccer and my favorite team is Manchester United. But of course, I love my New England Teams(Patriots, Red Sox, and Bruins).

...and I love pixar!
# Family
Family is very important to me. My parents worked hard their whole life to make sure my brothers and I had a good life. I have two brothers, one older and one younger (yes, that makes me the middle child). We have lived all over Brockton, MA.

Like I said, my parents are so hard working. My dad was a Marine and a Police Officer and my mom is an Emergency Room Nurse. My older brother lives in Berkeley, CA and is a developer. My younger brother works at East Middle School.
